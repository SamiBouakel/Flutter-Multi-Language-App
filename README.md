## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo`
3. Install dependencies: `flutter pub get`

## Usage

1. Run the app on your device or emulator: `flutter run`

## Localization (Internationalization)

The app supports multiple languages using the Flutter Intl package. To add or modify translations:

1. Navigate to the `lib/l10n` directory.
2. Open the `intl_messages.arb` file.
3. Add/modify translations.
4. Generate translation files: `flutter pub run intl_translation:generate_from_arb --output-dir=lib/l10n --no-use-deferred-loading lib/localization.dart lib/l10n/intl_*.arb`

## State Management (GetX)

GetX is used for state management. Check the `lib/controllers` directory for state management logic.

## Weather Data API

This app retrieves real-time weather data using a third-party API. The API provides up-to-date weather information for various locations worldwide. To use the API in your project, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for an API key at [API Provider's Website](API Provider's URL).
2. Open the `lib/api/weather_api.dart` file.
3. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key you obtained in step 1.
